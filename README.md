Thickness distribution optimization in flat panels for damage tolerance using genetic algorithms

This file explains the working of the genetic algorithm used for the thickness distribution optimalisation. Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the algorithm steps out of which it is built.

## Versions

2.0 - Revised version based on feedback and new flowchart [Feb '18 - Present].
1.0 - Initial version of the algorithm which was created until the more elaborate flowchart [Sept '17  - Jan '18].
